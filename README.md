# Should I Watch..?

 Week 3 API Project Starring Hannah, Caroline, Natalie and Jem

## Objective

To create a page that utilises 2 or more API calls and then displays the returned data.

## User Journey

We created a page which allows a user to search for a film and returns the following information;

* The rating (0-10)
* Date of release
* Brief synopsis
* Poster
* A gif related to the rating of the film (ie. a rating below 4 is thumbs down, 4-5 is ok, 6-7 is thumbs up and 8+ is applause).


#### APIs we used:
- MovieDB
- GIPHY

## Requirements

* Software Architecture: we split the Javascript into 3 files - logic.js dom.js and test.js
* Tests - we created basic tests for the returned objects from API calls and also used QUnit

## Our Planning

## Work Flow

From our planning stage we had a skeleton HTML and the Javascript functions that we wanted to write.

We then split into pairs to write the functions.

## Lessons Learnt

* Testing

We now realise that it is difficult to test once all of the code is written. As each of our functions depended on others passing information it was hard to test in isolation, so it is important to practise Test Driven Development from the start!


* Plan visual design/layout at same time as architecture

Once we had a functional page we took a long to to decide how to style it!

## What Went Well

* Actually getting the page and functions to work.

As a group we found this part quite straight forward. Even though the functions may not be 'pure', the time we spent planning and then sticking to the plan meant that we were able to display the information we wanted quite quickly.

* Pull Requests

From our work in previous groups we decided it would be a good idea to check in with each other at each Pull Request to make sure that everyone understood the code. As a result we have all learnt a lot.
